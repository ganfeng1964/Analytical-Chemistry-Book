## 1.1 What is analytical chemistry?

Analytical chemistry is a distinct branch of the chemical sciences. Even before chemistry was formally established as a discipline, elements of analytical chemistry were already in practice. Ancient peoples regularly encountered chemical reactions in their daily lives that spark their curiosity. This curiosity led them to ponder chemical phenomena, raise various questions about these reactions, and devise methods to analyze them. Such activities can be seen as the early stages of qualitative analysis, a critical aspect of modern analytical chemistry. Interestingly, the content of qualitative analysis has largely been shifted out of contemporary analytical chemistry textbooks and integrated into others, such as inorganic chemistry textbooks.

Qualitative analysis played an important role in early development of analytical chemistry (and chemistry). It mainly pays close attention to identify what substances are present in a sample. Take the combustion of wood as an example. For ancient people, burning wood for cooking, heating and lighting should be their most important daily activities. They undoubtedly pondered over questions like: What triggers the combustion of wood? What component within wood enables it to burn? It is natural for them to raise such kind of questions because they could easily chop wood and burn it but they can't just pick up a stone and burn it! Fortunately, they did find a type of "stone" capable of burning, which we know today as coal. As time passed, the ancients identified more substances that could burn and, similar to wood, these substances emitted light and heat when ignited. This observation led to the inevitable question: Why do these materials burn in such a manner?

Throughout history, many people have tried to explain the phenomenon of combustion and numerous hypotheses have been presented to explain it. In the 18th century, Georg Ernst Stahl put forward the widely accepted hypothesis of "phlogiston". Due to its excellent explanation of the phenomenon of combustion, the phlogiston theory was once revered as a truth and it controlled human thinking for about 100 years. From the perspective of production practice, the theory of phlogiston has a huge driving effect on the development of chemistry, at least helpful for mineral smelting. However, from a theoretical perspective, the phlogiston theory is concerning because from the beginning, phlogiston was just a hypothesis, and people have never been able to find it in reality. Just like a ghost. Many intelligent people have questioned the theory of phlogiston and attempted to refute it through various experiments. However, if the experimental methods used remain within the framework of qualitative analysis, it would be futile to ultimately prove or refute the phlogiston theory. 

In 1774, Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier started his approaches on the theory of phlogiston. The notable feature of his experiments were the use of a closed system and a balance. For example, Lavoisier conducted experiments on roasting tin. He placed accurately weighed tin into a retort, sealed it, and accurately weighed the total weight of the closed system. Then, he heated the retort to turn the tin into ashes (red mercuric oxide). He weighed the closed system again and found that the total weight had not changed! When he opened the retort, he noticed a phenomenon: he felt gas to rush into the retort! He also found that the weight of the ashes was greater than the weight of tin. However, according to the phlogiston theory, the phlogiston in tin should escape during the combustion process, and the weight of the remaining ashes should be smaller. Moreover, the external gas rushing into the retort also meant that the gas inside was "absorbed" by something, which led to negative pressure. 

Among Lavoisier's experiments, the most significant one was the burning of mercury in air. He placed a certain amount of mercury in a retort and heated it. The retort had a limited amount of air. He heated the retort to about 350°C for about twelve days. He found that mercury turned into red solid (now we know it is HgO). Then, Lavoisier took a crucial step: he took out of red solid and heated it again. He found that the red solid turned back into mercury by releasing a gas. He collected the released gas and found it has combustibility. He named the gas the "oxygen" and believed it was essential for combustion. 

This experiment was pivotal because it disproved the then-prevailing phlogiston theory. Lavoisier's findings laid the foundation of quantitative analysis. Balance becomes the essential tool in finding new substances, establishing principals of chemical reactions, and leading to the development of the concept of chemical elements and compounds. It is not an exaggeration to say that modern chemistry was established based on the development of quantitative analysis.

Currently, analytical chemistry has become a vast discipline and been equipped with various advanced analytical instruments. Unlike other branches of chemistry focused on synthesis or theory, analytical chemistry is primarily concerned with the practical aspects of what matter is made of, how much of it is there, and how its components interact with each other. This field is fundamental in both academic research and various industries, underpinning innovations and quality control in pharmaceuticals, environmental monitoring, food safety, and many other areas. 

As a matter of fact, analytical chemistry has been integrated into all aspects of human activity in a subtle and silent way: although you may not feel its existence, it is right beside you. When you click on this text with your mouse, do you know if the lead content in the mouse you are using exceeds the limit? Don't worry, analytical chemistry has solved these problems for you.

## 1.2 A definition of analytical chemistry

You should have read the above contents, I guess you haven't really understood what analytical chemistry is. People always like to make something more clear by setting a definition on it. There are a lot of definitions of analytical chemistry. Here, we only provide the one from the department of analytical chemistry of European Federation.

> Analytical chemistry is the science that investigates the development and application of methods, instruments and strategies to find the composition of materials. 

This seemingly simple definition captures a comprehensive and nuanced aspect of analytical chemistry. It emphasizes not just the identification (qualitative analysis) and quantification (quantitative analysis) of material composition, which is central to traditional definitions, but also highlights the dynamic and innovative nature of the field. Now let's take a closer look at its key components:

1. **Science of Investigation**: This positions analytical chemistry within the scientific realm of systematic investigation and empirical inquiry. It's not just about applying known techniques; it's about actively exploring and understanding materials. 

2. **Development of Methods**: Analytical chemistry is continuously evolving, with ongoing research and development of new methods. This encompasses creating more accurate, sensitive, and efficient ways to analyze materials. 

3. **Application of Instruments**: The field heavily relies on various instruments, ranging from basic tools like pH meters to advanced devices like mass spectrometers and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers. This underscores the technical and technological aspects of analytical chemistry. 

4. **Strategies for Analysis**: This points to the planning, designing, and implementing of analytical procedures. It's not just about the "how" but also about the "why" and the "when" of using specific analytical methods.

5. **Finding Composition of Materials**: At its core, analytical chemistry seeks to determine what substances are present in a sample (qualitative analysis) and in what amount (quantitative analysis). This is crucial across a myriad of sectors, including pharmaceuticals, environmental science, and forensics.

In the perspective of European Federation, the definition reflects the viewpoint and standards of a significant scientific body in Europe, suggesting a harmonized and advanced approach to analytical chemistry in the context of European research and industry standards.This definition underscores analytical chemistry as a dynamic, evolving discipline that is fundamental to both scientific understanding and practical applications in various industries.

The definition is a very nice one. However, it may be overly optimistic about analytical chemistry. It should be noted that the widespread application of instruments has indeed promoted the development of analytical chemistry, but from another perspective, it has also brought a "survival" crisis to analytical chemistry. Due to many instruments being based on physical principles, modern analytical chemistry is more like physical analysis. This is an undeniable fact. What should analytical chemistry rely on to reserve its position as an unique discipline?

In history, there was a period when many universities abolished the speciality of analytical chemistry. The reason is surprisingly that analytical chemistry was merely a speciality that only applies the theory of chemistry and physics. Analytical chemistry has indeed done a lot of scientific explorations, but can it be recognized as a science widely recognized by the scientific community based on this? 

## 1.3 Is analytical chemistry a science?

The term science is already a term that cannot be further popularized. It is not an exaggeration to say that the term science has become a popular pet phrase among the public. Any profession that adopts certain scientific technologies dares to call itself a science. For example, "face job" had become "beauty science". Some people who have undergone short-term training dare to use knives on others' faces, of course, I mean using some seemingly high-tech tools. Of course, doing so would be much better than having a butcher do it. Just kidding!

As a scientist who teaches analytical chemistry, I have always believed that analytical chemistry is a science until I once listened to Professor Ruqin Yu's[^1] report titled "Chemometrics-assisted Mathematization and Informatization of Analytical Chemistry and Emergence of New Research Paradigm". It exposed me to the philosopher Kant's[^2] views on science. In Kant's view, a discipline can only be regarded as a science proper if it has been mathematized. And, Kant thought "...chemistry can’t be anything more than a systematic art or experimental doctrine, never a science proper, because the principles of chemistry are merely empirical and can’t be presented a priori in intuition...". Among modern scientists, there are also many who believe that chemistry cannot become an independent (separate) discipline, and some scientists are even more extreme. For example, Dirac[^3] said "The underlying laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that exact applications of these laws lead to equations which are too complicated to be soluble." So, if chemistry cannot even become a science, let alone analytical chemistry. Analytical chemistry is simply an existence of "neither fish nor fowl" (“爹不亲娘不爱”）

Professor Yu suggested implementing the mathematization of analytical chemistry based on chemometrics and proposed several paradigms. I think this path is not feasible. The reason is that chemometrics methods are essentially based on calibration techniques, which are themselves relative methods. These methods are fundamentally no longer based on the theory of chemical reactions, although they involve chemical reactions. Due to the fact that these methods are more based on instrumental analysis methods, which are essentially based on physical principles, using chemometrics theory to achieve the mathematization of analytical chemistry feels like “barking up the wrong tree”（缘木求鱼）. My view is not disrespectful because I myself study chemometrics.
