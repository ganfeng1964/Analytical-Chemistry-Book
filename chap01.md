## 1.1 What is analytical chemistry?

Analytical chemistry is a distinct branch of the chemical sciences. Even before chemistry was formally established as a discipline, elements of analytical chemistry were already in practice. Ancient peoples regularly encountered chemical reactions in their daily lives that spark their curiosity. This curiosity led them to ponder chemical phenomena, raise various questions about these reactions, and devise methods to analyze them. Such activities can be seen as the early stages of qualitative analysis, a critical aspect of modern analytical chemistry. Interestingly, the content of qualitative analysis has largely been shifted out of contemporary analytical chemistry textbooks and integrated into others, such as inorganic chemistry textbooks.

Qualitative analysis played an important role in early development of analytical chemistry (and chemistry). It mainly pays close attention to identify what substances are present in a sample. Take the combustion of wood as an example. For ancient people, burning wood for cooking, heating and lighting should be their most important daily activities. They undoubtedly pondered over questions like: What triggers the combustion of wood? What component within wood enables it to burn? It is natural for them to raise such kind of questions because they could easily chop wood and burn it but they can't just pick up a stone and burn it! Fortunately, they did find a type of "stone" capable of burning, which we know today as coal. As time passed, the ancients identified more substances that could burn and, similar to wood, these substances emitted light and heat when ignited. This observation led to the inevitable question: Why do these materials burn in such a manner?

Throughout history, many people have tried to explain the phenomenon of combustion and numerous hypotheses have been presented to explain it. In the 18th century, Georg Ernst Stahl put forward the widely accepted hypothesis of "phlogiston". Due to its excellent explanation of the phenomenon of combustion, the phlogiston theory was once revered as a truth and it controlled human thinking for about 100 years. From the perspective of production practice, the theory of phlogiston has a huge driving effect on the development of chemistry, at least helpful for mineral smelting. However, from a theoretical perspective, the phlogiston theory is concerning because from the beginning, phlogiston was just a hypothesis, and people have never been able to find it in reality. Just like a ghost. Many intelligent people have questioned the theory of phlogiston and attempted to refute it through various experiments. However, if the experimental methods used remain within the framework of qualitative analysis, it would be futile to ultimately prove or refute the phlogiston theory. 

In 1774, Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier started his approaches on the theory of phlogiston. The notable feature of his experiments were the use of a closed system and a balance. For example, Lavoisier conducted experiments on roasting tin. He placed accurately weighed tin into a retort, sealed it, and accurately weighed the total weight of the closed system. Then, he heated the retort to turn the tin into ashes (red mercuric oxide). He weighed the closed system again and found that the total weight had not changed! When he opened the retort, he noticed a phenomenon: he felt gas to rush into the retort! He also found that the weight of the ashes was greater than the weight of tin. However, according to the phlogiston theory, the phlogiston in tin should escape during the combustion process, and the weight of the remaining ashes should be smaller. Moreover, the external gas rushing into the retort also meant that the gas inside was "absorbed" by something, which led to negative pressure. 

Among Lavoisier's experiments, the most significant one was the burning of mercury in air. He placed a certain amount of mercury in a retort and heated it. The retort had a limited amount of air. He heated the retort to about 350°C for about twelve days. He found that mercury turned into red solid (now we know it is HgO). Then, Lavoisier took a crucial step: he took out of red solid and heated it again. He found that the red solid turned back into mercury by releasing a gas. He collected the released gas and found it has combustibility. He named the gas the "oxygen" and believed it was essential for combustion. 

This experiment was pivotal because it disproved the then-prevailing phlogiston theory. Lavoisier's findings laid the foundation of quantitative analysis. Balance becomes the essential tool in finding new substances, establishing principals of chemical reactions, and leading to the development of the concept of chemical elements and compounds.
