# Analytical Chemistry

## Preface

This is a personal project that focus on writing a book on Analytical Chemistry in English. The reasons are as followings:

1. I have been learning English for many many .... years, but I always struggle to write good enough English stuffs. 

2. I had published a book on Analytical Chemistry in Chinese (ISBN 978-7-03-063519-8). However, it seems too advanced to be accepted by most people. Some guy even called me to slow down. So, I try to challenge English speaking people.

3. I want to force myself to become a Git user. I will include some Julia codes in the book, but don't expect them to be perfect ones.  

4. I want to write a book in my own way. Just for fun.
