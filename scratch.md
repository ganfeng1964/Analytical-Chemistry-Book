The current status of analytical chemistry as of early 2023 can be summarized by several key trends and advancements:

1. **Technological Advancements**: There have been significant improvements in analytical instruments, leading to higher sensitivity, accuracy, and speed. Mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and chromatographic techniques continue to evolve rapidly.

2. **Miniaturization and Automation**: The trend towards miniaturization, such as lab-on-a-chip technologies, allows for more efficient and less resource-intensive analysis. Automation and high-throughput technologies have become more prevalent, improving efficiency and reducing human error.

3. **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**: The integration of big data analytics and machine learning algorithms is becoming increasingly important. These tools can handle large datasets, uncover patterns, and make predictions that would be impossible for humans to discern manually.

4. **Environmental Analysis**: There is growing emphasis on environmental analysis, including the detection of pollutants and the study of environmental processes. Techniques like remote sensing and real-time monitoring systems are gaining prominence.

5. **Biological Applications**: Analytical chemistry is increasingly intertwined with biology and medicine. This includes applications in genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and personalized medicine, where analytical techniques are vital for understanding biological processes and disease states.

6. **Nanotechnology**: The development of nanomaterials and nanoparticles has created new opportunities in analytical chemistry, particularly in enhancing the sensitivity and selectivity of analytical methods.

7. **Sustainability and Green Chemistry**: There is a growing focus on sustainability, leading to the development of greener analytical methods that reduce the use of harmful reagents and solvents and minimize waste.

8. **Regulatory and Quality Assurance**: Compliance with regulatory standards and quality assurance remains a crucial aspect, especially in industries like pharmaceuticals, food, and environmental monitoring.

9. **Education and Skill Development**: The field is also witnessing changes in education and skill requirements, with a greater emphasis on interdisciplinary knowledge and data handling skills.

10. **Global Health Challenges**: Analytical chemists are increasingly involved in addressing global health challenges, such as drug development, disease detection, and monitoring of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in the environment.

This summary provides an overview of the field as of my last training data. For the most current information, consulting recent scientific literature or news in the field of analytical chemistry would be beneficial.
