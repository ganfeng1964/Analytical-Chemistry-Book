# Processing and Evaluating Analytical Data

Data processing and evaluating are critical processes in chemical quantitative analysis. The quantitative analysis process involves a series of measurement processes, which naturally generate a series of data. How to process the data, how to evaluate the data, and how to obtain useful information from the data are the fundamental skill that every analyst must master. 

The purpose of chemical quantitative analysis is to obtain the quantity of an analyte. When the analyte does exist, we can assume that the quantity of the analyte must be non-zero and have a definite value. The value is usually referred to as the true value of the quantity of the analyte and presented it using Greek characters $\mu$. Due to the complexity of chemical systems, we often cannot directly obtain the real $\mu$ value. We must first measure certain related quantities, such as mass, volume, etc., and use them to estimate the $\mu$. The mass is measured by the balance while the volume the flask. However, there are many interference factors during the measurement process, which can lead to certain uncertainty. This chapter will discuss the influencing factors in the chemical measurement process and the processing methods of measured data.

The content of this chapter is mainly based on statistics. If you are familiar with statistics, you can skip this chapter. For students majoring in chemistry, most do not have specialized statistics courses, so I suggest them  to learn this chapter. I cannot fully explain the content of statistics in such a short chapter, I can only provide a few things that I think students need to know. My presentations are based on my level of knowledge. If you can grab the content of this chapter, congratulations, you are on an equal footing with me.

> In physics and measurement, the "True Value" of an object's mass refers to the exact and error free numerical value of the object's mass. In an ideal situation, the true value is the absolute accuracy of the object's mass, unaffected by any measurement errors, instrument accuracy, environmental conditions (such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure), and other factors.
