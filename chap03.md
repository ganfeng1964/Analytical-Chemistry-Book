# Precipitation Gravimetry

Precipitation gravimetry is one of gravimetric methods. The important feature of precipitation gravimetry is that it uses precipitation reactions to determine the mass of an analyte in a solution. Although there are other gravimetric methods, this e-book only introduces the principle of precipitation gravimetry, which is also the situation of most textbooks of analytical chemistry. 

Precipitation gravimetry, like other gravimetric methods, is no longer a mainstream analysis method but it does not mean that it is no longer an important method. The precipitation gravimetry is rarely used in routine analysis due to its cumbersome operation and time-consuming nature. However, as gravimetric analysis is based on balance, it is an absolute analysis method (so called the "ultimate method"), other quantitative analysis methods must be able to trace back to gravimetry. The reason is that the results of the gravimetric analysis method can be calibrated using international standard, ensuring the authority of the analysis results. 

Thus, whether you are willing or not, the gravimetry will exist and still be an mandatory subject for undergraduate student even if you may never use this method in your lifetime.
